# School of DevOps

-  üõ†Ô∏è DevOps is a software development approach that combines development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams to streamline the software delivery process. It promotes collaboration, communication, and automation between these traditionally separate teams.

  - DevOps is not a specific job title or role, but rather a set of practices and principles that can be applied across a variety of roles in software development and IT operations. Anyone involved in the software development and delivery process can adopt a DevOps mindset and apply DevOps practices in their work, including developers, testers, operations engineers, product managers, and others.
